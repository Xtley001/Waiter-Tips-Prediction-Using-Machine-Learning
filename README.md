# Waiter-Tips-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting waiter tips based on various features such as total bill amount, gender of the customer, smoking status, day of the week, meal time, and party size. The project demonstrates data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using a well-known dataset.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately estimate the tips given to waiters in a restaurant setting. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we can understand the factors that influence tipping behavior and make data-driven predictions.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the "tips" dataset, which is commonly used for demonstration purposes in data science. It includes the following columns:

total_bill: The total bill amount (including the cost of food and drinks).
tip: The tip amount.
sex: Gender of the person paying the bill (male or female).
smoker: Whether the person is a smoker (yes or no).
day: Day of the week (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday).
time: Time of day (lunch or dinner).
size: Size of the party.
Features
Data preprocessing and cleaning.
Exploratory data analysis (EDA).
Feature engineering.
Model training and evaluation.
Visualization of results.
Installation
To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/waiter-tips-prediction.git
cd waiter-tips-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Data Preprocessing:

Loading and inspecting the dataset.
Handling missing values and outliers.
Encoding categorical variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis:

Visualizing the distribution of tips.
Analyzing the relationship between features and the target variable.
Feature Engineering:

Creating new features from existing data.
Normalizing and scaling features.
Model Training and Evaluation:

Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
Training various regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest).
Evaluating model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared.
Visualization:

Plotting predicted vs. actual tips.
Visualizing feature importance.
